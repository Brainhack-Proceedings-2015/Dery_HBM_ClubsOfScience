\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Our ability to quantitatively study large-scale social and behavioural
phenomena such as peer influence and confirmation bias within scientific
circles rest on quality and relevant data
\cite{BiologicalNetworks:Freeman2004}. Yet the compilation of specific
coauthorship databases are often restricted to certain well-defined
fields of study or publication resources, limiting the extent and depth
by which investigations can be performed. Ultimately, we aim to
understand how the social construct and its underlying dynamics
influence the trajectories of scientific endeavours
\cite{Sarigol2014:PredictingSuccess}. This work is motivated by an
interest in observing social patterns, monitoring their evolution, and
possibly understanding the emergence and spreading of ideas and their
biases in the neuroimaging community; central themes to deciphering
facts from opinions. However, before being able to fully investigate and
address these fundamental and inherently complex questions, we need to
address the extraction and validation of data. The goal of this project
was to leverage publicly available information on Google Scholar (GS) to
automaticaly extract coauthorship networks.

\section{Approach}\label{approach}

The tool can be accessed through a public website at
(http://cos.dery.xyz). The site is constructed using a set of openly
accessible libraries allowing the display of coauthorship networks as
interactive graphs \cite{Holten2009:ForceDirected}. Visitors can peruse
a set of pre-computed networks extracted using custom Python scripts
designed to crawl GS based on a set of predefined constraints
(e.g.~search topic, publication journal). The proposed interface offers
seamless manipulation to keep interaction straightforward and easy to
use. The simplicity of the design aims to reach a maximum number of
users, assuming a minimal level of technical knowledge.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{GraphConstruction}:}{:}}\label{section}

Scholarly citations are commonly found in standardized format,
suggesting the structure can be reliably used within an automatic
procedure. Moreover, while the result of typical search engines are not
structured towards data mining (i.e.~mixture of natural language
embedded in semi-structured tags and page links), particular
combinations of HTML tags and CSS identifiers can be leveraged to
extract specific information. This simple scheme allows the
reconstruction of large-scale networks of collaborations. Interestingly,
Google Scholar also hosts individual pages for authors' rich with
pre-computed metrics of scientific productivity and impact
(e.g.~cumulative number of citations, h-index, i10-index). This data can
be further exploited to structure and highlight part of the network.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{CommunityDetection}:}{:}}\label{section-1}

Scientific communities were detected using a greedy agglomerative
modularity optimization process \cite{Blondel08fastunfolding}.

Totals & 99 & 44 & 61 & 49.06\% & 76.69\% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subparagraph{Validation:}\label{validation}

To assess the recovered network's reliability we performed a spot check
on its content. First we examined the accuracy of 100 randomly selected
researchers from the network and sought after their departmental
affiliation and publication journals to confirm their belongin to the
broad field of neuroimaging. The dependence on profiles availability
injects a strong negative bias. To better appreciate the crawling
ability to construct network we further compare with the number of
members having a Google Scholar page in the form of a corrected
accuracy.

\section{Results}\label{results}

96 researchers were confirmed to have direct institutional affiliation
to neuroscience, psychology, or biomedical engineering departments. The
remaining 4 randomly selected researchers were found to work in the
fields of human genome sequencing, image analysis, nano particles, and
pharmacology. Note that these individuals were located on the outskirts
of the main graph. To further assess completeness of the network, we
compared results with faculty rosters of 5 major neuroimaging institutes
(Table 1).

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Accuracy results suggest a sufficient number of individuals are
registered through GS to make it a useful platform of discovery.
Meticulous inspection of the grouping suggest that communities typically
embed either a geographical or a topical component, that is to say,
certain communities are seemingly brought together by either proximity
or similarity of interest. With the increasing complexity of science,
finding accurate and relevant information on specific topics is a
challenging task. We feel that a better appreciation of the wealth and
variety of opinions within scientific communities may help enforcing the
notion that grand claims require grand evidence.
